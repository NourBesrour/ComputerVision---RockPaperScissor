This project enables users to detect rock, paper, or scissors gestures using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and computer vision techniques.

## Overview
This project utilizes deep learning with CNN architecture to classify hand gestures as rock, paper, or scissors. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of these gestures. Computer vision techniques are employed to preprocess the input images and improve classification accuracy.

## Features
Real-time gesture detection using a webcam or camera input.
High accuracy in classifying rock, paper, or scissors gestures.
Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning tasks.
Easy-to-understand code structure for further customization or extension.

## Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
Keras
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
